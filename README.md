- Utilized data visualization techniques, including graphs and charts, to better understand data distribution and relationships.

### Machine Learning Algorithms Implemented
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Neural Network
- Decision Tree

### Performance Evaluation
- Implemented confusion matrix to evaluate the performance of each algorithm.
- Calculated cross-validated F1 scores to measure the accuracy and robustness of the models.
- Generated ROC curves to assess the trade-off between true positive and false positive rates for each algorithm.

### Statistical Significance Testing
- Conducted statistical significance tests to ensure the validity and reliability of the model results.

## Tools and Technologies
